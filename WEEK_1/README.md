# Week 1 – Generative AI Lab

## Subject
CSET-419 – Introduction to Generative AI

## Experiment 1
Implementation of a Simple Generative Algorithm for Data Generation

## Objective

To generate synthetic image data using a pre-trained generative model and create a dataset using Python.

## Domain Selected

Image Data Generation

## Model Used

Stable Diffusion (Pre-trained Diffusion Model)

## Description

In this lab, a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model was used to generate synthetic images from text prompts. The model converts textual descriptions into realistic images using a diffusion-based generative process.

The generated images were stored in a dataset folder and saved in PNG format. The dataset was then compressed into a ZIP file for submission.

## Key Concepts Covered

- Generative AI
- Diffusion Models
- Text-to-Image Generation
- Synthetic Data Creation
- Pre-trained Models

## Output
A synthetic image dataset generated from 5 text prompts.
