## 🔹 Component I: LSTM Based Text Generation

### Steps Performed:
1. Loaded and preprocessed text dataset  
2. Applied word-level tokenization  
3. Created input-output sequences  
4. Built an LSTM model using Keras  
5. Trained the model  
6. Generated new text using a seed sentence  

### Output:
The trained model successfully generated new text sequences based on learned patterns from the dataset.
